Orange diseases cause significant yield loss, and traditional detection methods are slow and require expert knowledge. Additionally, improper pesticide use harms crops and the environment. This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that detects orange diseases and recommends optimal pesticides, ensuring timely action, improved yield.
